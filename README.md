## CatBoost Multiclass Classification - Iris Dataset

This project uses **CatBoost**, a gradient boosting algorithm, to classify the **Iris flower species** based on sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained on the **Iris dataset**, which contains three classes: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**. The project includes a **Jupyter Notebook** for training and evaluation, along with a **Gradio** web interface for interactive predictions.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Uses **CatBoostClassifier** for high-performance classification  
- Trains on the **Iris dataset** with 4 input features  
- Saves and loads the model using **joblib**  
- Evaluates performance with **accuracy and classification metrics**  
- Provides an **interactive UI** for predictions using **Gradio**
